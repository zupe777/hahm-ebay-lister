        <h2 className="section-label">What we collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Photos you upload.</strong> They are resized in your browser
            and sent to our server only to generate listing text. They are{" "}
            <strong>not stored</strong> after the listing is written.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Your eBay connection.</strong> If you connect eBay, we store
            an encrypted token in a cookie in your browser so the app can post
            listings on your behalf. We never see your eBay password.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="section-label">What we share</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Photos and listing text are sent to <strong>Anthropic</strong> (the
            AI that writes the listing) and, when you choose to post, to{" "}
            <strong>eBay</strong> to create your listing.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not sell your data or share it with anyone else.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="section-label">Your control</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can disconnect eBay at any time, which deletes the stored token.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clearing your browser cookies removes your saved eBay connection.
          </li>
        </ul>
